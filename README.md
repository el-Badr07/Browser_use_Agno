# Agno Framework â€“ Browser Tool Integration (PR)

## Introduction

> ðŸ“Œ **Note**: This repository is a pull request to add the `browser_use` tool for the [Agno framework](https://github.com/<original-agno-repo>).  
> It demonstrates the integration of a browser automation tool that allows agents to interact with the web, perform searches, and extract live data.

The Agno framework is a powerful tool for building intelligent agents. It provides a flexible and extensible architecture for integrating various tools and models to create sophisticated agents capable of performing complex tasks.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Easily integrate new tools and models.
- **Extensible**: Add custom tools and models to extend the framework's capabilities.
- **Asynchronous**: Built with asyncio for high performance and scalability.

## Installation

To install the Agno framework, use the following command:

```bash
pip install agno
````

## Usage

### Basic Example

Here's a basic example of how to create an agent using the Agno framework:

```python
import asyncio
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.groq import Groq
from agno.tools.mcp import MCPTools

async def main():
    agent = Agent(
        model=Groq(api_key="your_groq_api_key"),
        tools=[MCPTools()],
        role="You are an intelligent assistant.",
    )
    response = await agent.aprint_response("Hello, how can I assist you today?")
    print(response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Adding Browser Use as a Tool

This PR introduces the `BrowserTool`, enabling agents to perform live web searches and interact with web content programmatically.

#### Example

```python
import asyncio
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.tools.browser import BrowserTool
from agno.models.groq import Groq

async def main():
    browser_tool = BrowserTool(headless=False)
    agent = Agent(
        model=Groq(api_key="your_groq_api_key"),
        tools=[browser_tool],
        role="You are a web browsing assistant.",
    )
    response = await agent.aprint_response("Search for the latest news on AI.")
    print(response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

In this example, the `BrowserTool` allows the agent to perform real-time web browsing and data extraction.
